h1. About

This is a base library for my personal projects that eventually will be an
application framework.

Is a common library for code that don't use any other dependency and that does not
exists (or have a different conception) in other Java libraries like Apache Commons.

It will contain common libraries code:
* Model
* Time
* Tuple

It also contains the Maven infrastructure for creating other projects:
* Archetypes
* Skins
* Root POM

Eventually this code will be refactored to make an app framework. The objective is
to support Web (template system) and Swing for clients, NoSql and JDBC for storage
and REST for RPC.

h1. Usage

Maven project, you just can import it from your IDE It requires a JDK 1.7 and Maven 3.

The documentation is in "jamming.github.com/popapp":http://jamming.github.com/popapp.
