/**
 * Priorities:
 * 1) Use only Java, avoid config
 * 2) Good defaults
 * 3) Avoid error posibilities, typesafe
 * 4) Write less code
 * 5) Try to avoid setup
 * 6) Cut boilerplate code
 * 7) Runtime checking to fail early (check annotations, keys, etc) to avoid possible error.
 *    It's preferred to not allow fails at compile time
