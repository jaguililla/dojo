ABOUT
-----

Dojo literally means "the place for the path" and this is it. This is the place where I'll put
my practices.

It would be so messy to mix practices, proofs of concept, programming events code with other
projects, so this one is just for that.

The module format will be: Gradle + Java + Groovy + Scala... if I add more languages,
I'll add more build tools, candidates are Javascript, Coffeescript, Ruby, Python

Practise leads to perfection, but perfection is not a goal, is a path. So keep practising my
friend!

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
-------------------

A module (directory) for each event. Each module can have several packages for different
practices.

BUILD
-----

gradle test

LANGUAGES
---------

Add support for other interesting languages like:

* Clojure (LISP)
* Ocalm (ML)
* Javascript
* Coffeescript
* Python: https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonTestingToolsTaxonomy
