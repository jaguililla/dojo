Dojo literally means "the place for the path" and this is it. This is the place where I'll put my
 practices.

It would be so messy to mix every event with other projects, so this one is just for that.

Practise leads to perfection, but perfection is not a goal, is a path. So keep practising.

Structure.

A module for each event

The module format will be: Gradle + Java + Groovy + Scala... if I add more languages,
I'll add more build tools, candidates are Javascript, Coffeescript, Ruby, Python



Post: why I chose Groovy as the third language

Clojure (LISP) and Ocalm (ML)
